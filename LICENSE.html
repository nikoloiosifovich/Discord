If the changes affect your usage of Discord or your legal rights, we’ll notify you no less than seven days before the changes take effect.

For additional terms regarding our Nitro subscription service, please see the “Nitro Subscriptions” section below.</p><p>  The Service may include an opportunity to obtain virtual currency (&quot;Virtual Currency&quot;) or virtual goods (&quot;Virtual Goods&quot;) that may require you to pay a fee using legal tender (that is, &quot;real money&quot;) to obtain the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods. Your purchase of Virtual Currency is final and is not refundable, exchangeable, transferable, except in the Company’s or the platform provider’s sole discretion. You may not purchase, sell, or exchange Virtual Currency outside the Service. Doing so is a violation of the Terms and may result in termination of your Account with the Service and/or legal action. The Company retains the right to modify, manage, control and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods at its sole discretion. Prices and availability of Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. We shall have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights. You shall have a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable permission to use solely within the Service Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you have earned, purchased or otherwise obtained in a manner authorized by the Company. You have no other right, title or interest in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating in the Service.</p><p>  <u>Product Descriptions</u>. We try to make the Service thorough, accurate, and helpful to our customers. Nonetheless, there may be times when certain information contained on the Service may be incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or appear inaccurate because of the browser, hardware, software, or other technology that you use. Discord reserves the right, with or without prior notice, to: change descriptions or references to products and/or services; limit the available quantity of any product or service; honor, or refuse to honor, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; and/or refuse to provide any visitor to, or use of the Service with any product or service.</p><p>  <u>Availability and Pricing</u>. Though we try to honor all purchase requests, availability cannot always be guaranteed. When an item is not available and cannot be replenished — for example, if we offer a limited promotion — we will attempt to remove the item from the Service in a timely manner but make no guarantees in this regard. We may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on the Service. If a product’s correct price is higher than the listed price, we will either confirm that we’ll provide the item at the price listed or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p><p>  <u>Payments</u>. We accept major credit cards, certain debit cards, PayPal, and/or such other payment methods we may make available to you from time-to-time through our Service, as forms of payment (“Payment Method”). We may also offer you the ability to make orders through a third party app store or other payment service. You agree to comply with their terms and any other requirements they may have. By submitting an order, you authorize Discord, or its designated payment processor, to charge the account you specify for the purchase amount.</p><p>  We may, in our sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice to you through your contact information or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. We may cancel a payment or prevent you from initiating future payments for any reason, including, without limitation, the following: (i) if you attempt to use the Service in breach of any applicable law or regulation, including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you use the Service in breach of these Terms; (iii) if we suspect fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity regarding a payment; (iv) if we detect, in our sole discretion, that your payments have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a relatively high risk of losses; or (v) failure to cooperate in an investigation or provide additional information when requested.</p><p>  <u>Refunds</u>. You can find our refund policy here: <a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071</a></p><p>  <u>Taxes</u>. Stated prices may not include sales and use taxes. If they do not, you are responsible for the payment of such taxes related to your purchase. We have the right to charge you for any taxes that we are required to pay or in fact collect related to your purchase.</p><p>  <u>International Orders</u>. You will be solely responsible for any license fees, customs duties, and other taxes and fees related to the export of the products from the United States.</p><p>  <u>Manufacturer EULAs and Other Terms</u>. You may be required to accept an end user license agreement (EULA) or other terms provided by the manufacturer prior to use of the product you ordered. A EULA or other terms may accompany the product you ordered.</p><h1>NITRO SUBSCRIPTIONS</h1><p>  <u>Recurring Billing</u>. By purchasing a Nitro subscription, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method on a recurring (e.g., monthly or yearly) basis for the applicable Nitro subscription charge, any and all taxes or possible transaction fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your use of the Nitro subscription service. Your payment to Discord will automatically renew at the end of your applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period.</p><p>  <u>Price Changes</u>. Discord may change the price for Nitro subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Nitro subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use Nitro after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from Nitro prior to the price change going into effect. We don’t want to charge you for something you don’t want, though, so if you cancel within 14 days of any price increases, we’ll provide you a refund.</p><p>  <u>Cancellation</u>. You may cancel your Nitro subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to Nitro through the end of the current subscription period. If you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. At our sole discretion, however, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (&quot;credits&quot;). The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance. To cancel, go to the &quot;User Settings&quot; screen in the Discord desktop or mobile app and follow the instructions for cancellation.</p><h1>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h1><p>  THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.</p><p>  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p><p>  You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p><p>  Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it. You must send any such notice to Discord by email to <a href="mailto:disputes@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">disputes@discord.com</a> and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p><p>  The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.</p><p>  Binding Arbitration. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.</p><p>  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p><p>  If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.</p><p>  You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to <a href="mailto:disputes@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">disputes@discord.com</a> and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p><p>  <u>Opt-Out Right</u>. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to <a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</a>. The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service. If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either. If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.</p><p>  <u>Survival</u>. This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.</p><h1>CLASS WAIVER</h1><p>  THIS SECTION AND THE PREVIOUS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.</p><p>  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p><p>  Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p><p>  The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.</p><p>  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims, or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in San Francisco, California.</p><p>  This Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.</p><h1>INTERNATIONAL USE; EXPORT CONTROLS</h1><p>  Software available in connection with the Service and the transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States export controls. No software may be downloaded from the Service or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the software is at your sole risk. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your use of the Service, including as it concerns online conduct and acceptable content.</p><h1>IOS APPLICATIONS</h1><p>  The following additional terms and conditions apply with respect to any App that the Company provides to you designed for use on an Apple iOS-powered mobile device (an “iOS App”):</p><ul><li>You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Discord only, and not with Apple, Inc. (“Apple”).</li><li>Your use of the Company’s iOS App must comply with Apple’s then-current App Store Terms of Service.</li><li>The Company, and not Apple, are solely responsible for our iOS App and the Services and Content available thereon. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance and support services with respect to our iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to our iOS App.</li><li>You agree that the Company, and not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to our iOS App or your possession and/or use of our iOS App.</li><li>You agree that the Company, and not Apple, shall be responsible, to the extent required by these Terms, for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party intellectual property infringement claim related to our iOS App or your possession and use of our iOS App.</li><li>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</li><li>You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our iOS App (e.g., you must not be in violation of your wireless data service terms of agreement when using the iOS App).</li><li>The parties agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these Terms as they relate to your license of the Company’s iOS App. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they relate to your license of the iOS App as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</li></ul><h1>GENERAL</h1><p>  <u>Governing Law</u>. By visiting or using the Service, you agree that the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws and regardless of your location, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the Company.</p><p>  Any claim or dispute between you and the Company that arises out of or is related to the Service and is not subject to arbitration shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California.</p><p>  <u>Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief</u>. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to the Company under these Terms are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which remedies at law are inadequate. The Company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.</p><p>  <u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to your use of the Service and any other subject matter hereof and cannot be changed or modified by you except as expressly posted on the Service by the Company. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software.</p><p>  <u>Waiver</u>. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p><p>  <u>Severability</u>. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#x27; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p>  <u>Course of Conduct/Trade Practice</u>. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms.</p><p>  <u>Assignment</u>. These Terms may not be assigned by you without the Company&#x27;s prior written consent, but are freely assignable by the Company. Subject to the foregoing restriction, these Terms will be binding on, inure to, and enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</p><p>  <u>Documentation of Compliance</u>. Upon the Company&#x27;s request, you will furnish the Company with any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms.</p><p>  <u>Interpretation</u>. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against the Company by virtue of having drafted them.</p><p>  <u>Defenses Based on Electronic Form of These Terms</u>. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.</p><p>  <u>Survival</u>. You agree that the provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive any termination of these Terms.</p><p>  <u>Contact</u>. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privacy@discord.com</a>.</p><p>  Discord is made possible through the work of other <a href="https://discordapp.com/acknowledgements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">open source software</a>.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="footerBlurple-1BSoUN footer-je22K2"><svg class="footerBackgroundBlurple-3m2rFK footerBackgroundPrimary-3ouTtT" preserveAspectRatio="none" width="1920" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 1920 330" version="1.1"><path class="footerBackgroundPaused-1Qgmbn footerBackgroundAnimate-1CHJYi" fill="#1a1c1e" fill-opacity="0.3" d="M140.881198,194.260295 C257.600568,129.32862 342.939626,119.84993 418.009939,203.154617 C493.080251,286.459305 545.728689,70.9046172 636.439626,63.9593047 C727.150564,57.0139922 768.99822,139.670242 858.802907,119.431961 C948.607595,99.1936797 1071.91228,-32.9977266 1243.91228,7.75227342 C1415.91228,48.5022734 1404.10369,208.584305 1508.27166,178.709305 C1612.43963,148.834305 1633.73291,79.913472 1711.63588,98.8569055 C1776.28676,114.577866 1819.96778,221.391836 1889.37253,185.808108 C2017.32661,120.206212 2004.01952,336.769569 2004.01952,336.769569 L271.635881,337 L-149.063338,337 C-149.063338,337 -245.850307,175.637635 -58.0633382,228.867188 C33.8652851,254.92501 64.1722713,236.933925 140.881198,194.260295 Z"></path></svg><div class="footerContent-_U2enW"><div class="navigation-18zSA-"><div class="logoWrap-1rGDvB"><a class="logo-28n2Vu" href="/"><img alt="Home" src="/assets/8c9701b98ad4372b58f13fd9f65f966e.svg"/></a></div><div class="navigationSection-1CjCJZ"><h3 class="navigationHeader-2Vp4n_">Product</h3><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/download"><span>Download</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/branding"><span>Branding</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/nitro"><span>Nitro</span></a></div><div class="navigationSection-1CjCJZ"><h3 class="navigationHeader-2Vp4n_">Developers</h3><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/sell-your-game"><span>Sell Your Game</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/rich-presence"><span>Rich Presence</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/verification"><span>Verification</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="/developers/applications">Applications</a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="/developers/docs">Documentation</a></div><div class="navigationSection-1CjCJZ"><h3 class="navigationHeader-2Vp4n_">Resources</h3><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="//support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us">Help &amp; Support</a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/guidelines"><span>Guidelines</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="//feedback.discordapp.com">Feedback</a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/terms"><span>Terms</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/privacy"><span>Privacy</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="//status.discordapp.com">Status</a></div><div class="navigationSection-1CjCJZ"><h3 class="navigationHeader-2Vp4n_">Company</h3><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/company"><span>About</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="//blog.discordapp.com/">Blog</a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/jobs"><span>Jobs</span></a></div><div class="navigationSection-1CjCJZ"><h3 class="navigationHeader-2Vp4n_">More</h3><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/partners"><span>Partners</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/hypesquad"><span>HypeSquad</span></a><a class="route-MFNjyu" href="mailto:press@discordapp.com">Press Inquiries</a><a class="route-MFNjyu" tabindex="0" href="/open-source"><span>Open Source</span></a></div></div><div class="separator-xZsY5U"></div><div class="joinDiscord-3gZEG_"><div class="stats-2t3ZLa"><h2 class="readyToJoin-3kZFcp">Ready to try Discord?
